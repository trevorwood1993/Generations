# Generations
Family Tree simulator
Written in PHP. Version 1

## How to use on your PC
#### 1. Download all files
#### 2. Import sql file into your database.
#### 3. Done, just use an apache server to run your php

## Tips;
Fertility is 0-7; 0 being infertile and 7 being virile

When modifying people refresh page if no changes take place.

## Current Issues;
The lines drawn from person to person are redrawn each time it loads with javascript, this is what causes it to slow down. If you want to disable you can. Just use CSS instead, it will be faster but the lines will not be precise.

Lines linking trees need to be done in complete css, any other way is just too slow. I haven't had a chance to redesign this in yet though.
